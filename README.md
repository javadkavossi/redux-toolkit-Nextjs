# Redux Toolkit with Next.js - Educational Project

This repository contains an educational project demonstrating how to use Redux Toolkit in a Next.js application. The goal is to teach the integration of state management using Redux Toolkit with the server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities of Next.js, showcasing best practices and common patterns.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on:

1. **Redux Toolkit Integration**: Learn how to integrate Redux Toolkit with a Next.js application for efficient state management.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Redux**: Understand how to use Redux alongside Next.js features like SSR and static site generation (SSG).
3. **State Management Best Practices**: Gain an understanding of managing global state, using slices, and working with middleware.

## Content

The project is organized into several sections, each with specific examples and explanations:

1. **Setup Redux Toolkit in Next.js**:
   - Learn how to set up Redux Toolkit and configure the store in a Next.js project.
   - Using `@reduxjs/toolkit` to create slices and manage state in a modular way.

2. **State Management Examples**:
   - **Counter Example**: A simple counter to demonstrate state manipulation with actions and reducers.
   - **API Integration**: Fetching data using Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` to handle asynchronous actions and integrate external APIs.

3. **Server-Side Integration**:
   - Implement SSR with Redux state, showcasing how to hydrate the state during server-side rendering.
   - Example of integrating Redux with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` for better performance and SEO.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **Next.js** and **Redux Toolkit** knowledge basics.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/javadkavossi/ReduxToolkit-Nextjs-Tutorial.git


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
